# Diabetes Prediction Binary Split Health Indocators
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of health indicators. The dataset contains 8 features and 1 target variable, where the features include sex, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, age group, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption. The target variable, `Diabetes_binary`, indicates whether the individual has diabetes based on a physical blood test. This model aims to help in the early detection of diabetes through the analysis of these health indicators.
